## ðŸ“– **About the Project**  
This project tackles the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**, one of the most well-known combinatorial optimization problems.  
Using **Python** and scientific computing libraries, the project provides an interactive approach to solving the TSP through algorithms and visualization tools implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.
